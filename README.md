# Buddy Bot ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ♡
Fun side project inspired by a bot within Bloomberg L.P's data engineering team. This is a bot which creates random pairs for members of Rutgers WiCS to meet. The goal of this bot is to increase the sense of community within WiCS especially in this remote environment by promoting small group meetups with new people. Put this together fairly quickly and working on new features.

## version 1.0
Created random pairs from a csv file, accounting for odd number of participants.

## version 1.1 (in progress) additions
parse email and full name, configure email send out, format email with html
